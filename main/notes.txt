We adjusted the ads1256 code, in function static UDOUBLE ADS1256_Read_ADC_Data(void) ==> DEV_Delay_ms(0.4); decreased delay in order to run code in 1ms. This value can be adjusted according to system power usage. 



The time calculated using a function called "chrono::highresolutionclock()"

The library required is to #include <chrono>

In the beginning of the code write: 
"auto start_time = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now();  "

At the end of the code write: 
"auto end_time = std::chrono::high_resolution_clock::now(); "

This code below calculates time pass of the code run in 1 cycle: 
"auto duration = std::chrono::duration_cast<std::chrono::microseconds>(end_time - start_time);  "
     
To print the code: 
float(duration.count())/1000
